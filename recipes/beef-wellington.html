    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Broiling Beef Wellington in the oven gives you grill-like results in the kitchen. Broiling is like grilling turned on its
        head,
        with the high heat coming from above the meat instead of below it. Both grilling and broiling are fast and easy.
        Here's
        how to broil in 5 easy steps.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Steak Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Before turning on the broiler, remove thawed steaks from the refrigerator and let them rest at room
            temperature for
            about 15 minutes. Then pat the steaks dry with paper towels and season the meat as you like.</li>
        <li>Trim excess fat from the meat to avoid grease flare-ups. Make a few vertical cuts along the edges of the
            steak to keep
            it from curling under the broiler.</li>
        <li>Situate the top oven rack to just below the broiler coils. Turn the oven on to broil. Allow it to preheat
            for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place steaks on a broiling pan—or if you don't have a broiling pan, make one: line a shallow baking sheet
            with foil and
            set a flat rack on top of it. But <strong>do not use a glass baking pan</strong> under the broiler — it will
            break under the high heat.</li>
        <li>Slide the steaks under the glowing coils. The distance between the top of the steaks and the heat source
            should be
            between 3 and 5 inches. If the top rack position is too close to the coils, lower the rack to the second
            position.</li>
    </ol>
