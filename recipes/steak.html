    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Broiling steak in the oven gives you grill-like results in the kitchen. Broiling is like grilling turned on its head,
    with the high heat coming from above the meat instead of below it. Both grilling and broiling are fast and easy. Here's
    how to broil in 5 easy steps.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Steak</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Steak Sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Before turning on the broiler, remove thawed steaks from the refrigerator and let them rest at room temperature for
        about 15 minutes. Then pat the steaks dry with paper towels and season the meat as you like.</li>
        <li>Trim excess fat from the meat to avoid grease flare-ups. Make a few vertical cuts along the edges of the steak to keep
        it from curling under the broiler.</li>
        <li>Situate the top oven rack to just below the broiler coils. Turn the oven on to broil. Allow it to preheat for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place steaks on a broiling pan—or if you don't have a broiling pan, make one: line a shallow baking sheet with foil and
        set a flat rack on top of it. But <strong>do not use a glass baking pan</strong> under the broiler — it will break under the high heat.</li>
        <li>Slide the steaks under the glowing coils. The distance between the top of the steaks and the heat source should be
        between 3 and 5 inches. If the top rack position is too close to the coils, lower the rack to the second position.</li>
    </ol>
